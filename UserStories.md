# User Stories

### Novice Users:
- As a novice user, I want to be able to access a help page so that I can reference it when I don't 
  remember how to use the app.

### Expert Users:
- As an expert user, I want to be able to save/load a game in progress so
  so that I can stop and resume playing at my own convenience.

  - Example:
    - Initial screen:
      
      <img src="./user-story-assets/save-menu.png" alt="save-menu" width="150px">
    
    - When 'save' button is pressed, current game state is saved and can be loaded 
     by pressing the adjacent 'load' button.


- As an expert user, I would like to be able to switch the look of the 
  application between light and dark themes so that I have a better
  time using the application in different lighting conditions.

  - Example:
    - Initial screen: 
    
      <img src="./user-story-assets/main-menu.png" alt="main menu" width="150px">
      
    - When light bulb button on top toolbar is clicked, background colour should
      should switch to black/dark grey and black title text should also
      change to the colour white.

### Language Learners:

  -As a language learner, I want many categories of words such as foods, animals, travel, to choose from so that I can improve my vocabulary in chunks and become faster at categorizing the vocabulary.

-As a language learner, I want a list of vocabulary words that I keep getting wrong so that I can focus more on the mistaken words to improve my knowledge. For example, the app will keep track of mistaken words in the "still learning" category, and words that the user gets correct frequently in the "mastered" category.

-As a language learner, I want the option of having a "favourite" option for the vocabulary words
so that I can refer back to it. For example, clicking the unfilled in bookmark beside the word will put it into the bookmarked words page.
