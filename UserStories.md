# User Stories

### Novice Users:
- As a novice user, I want to be able to access a help page so that I can reference it when I don't remember how to use the app.

### Expert Users:
- As an expert user, I want to be able to create my own vocabulary lists 
  so that I can practice specific words of my choosing.


- As an expert user, I would like to be able to switch the look of the 
  application between light and dark themes so that I have a better
  time using the application in different lighting conditions.

  Example: 

    - Initial screen: ![Image of main menu](./user-story-assets/main-menu.png)
	- When lightbulb button on top toolbar is clicked, background colour should
      should switch to black/dark grey and black title text should also
      change to the colour white.
