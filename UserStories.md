# User Stories

### Novice Users:
- As a novice user, I want to be able to access a help page so that I can reference it when I don't 
  remember how to use the app.

  - Example:
    - The 'question mark' symbol will always be on the top right of the app.

    - When the 'question mark' symbol is clicken, a new menu pops up and displays helpful tips
      and tutorials on how to play and navigate through the app.

- As a novice user, I would like there to be a hint button so that I can progress without being stuck on words.

  - Example:
    - If the user is stuck or not progressing in their sudoku game, they can press the "hint" button
      that can give them the direct translation of a random word in the word list being used.

    - The number of hints available will vary depending on the difficulty of the game (easy, medium, hard).

- As a novice user, I want to be able to access the word bank so that I can study and 
  review the words before I play the game.

  - Example:
    - On the main menu of the app, there is a 'Word List' button. If pressed, it takes the user 
      to a new menu of which there is another 'Practice' button where if pressed, the user can 
      view all the native words and their respective translation of the language being learned.


- As a novice user, I want there to be a stopwatch timer so that I can see how long it takes for me to solve the sudoku.

  - Example: 
    - When a user starts a sudoku game of any difficulty, a timer (counting upwards from zero) 
      is displayed on the screen. When the user finishes the sudoku game, the timer stops.
    
    - The sudoku vocabulary app will keep track of the user's best times.

### Expert Users:
- As an expert user, I want to be able to save/load a game in progress so
  so that I can stop and resume playing at my own convenience.

  - Example:
    - Initial screen:
      
      <img src="./user-story-assets/save-menu.png" alt="save-menu" width="150px">
    
    - When 'save' button is pressed, current game state is saved and can be loaded 
     by pressing the adjacent 'load' button.


- As an expert user, I would like to be able to switch the look of the 
  application between light and dark themes so that I have a better
  time using the application in different lighting conditions.

  - Example:
    - Initial screen: 
    
      <img src="./user-story-assets/main-menu.png" alt="main menu" width="150px">
      
    - When light bulb button on top toolbar is clicked, background colour should
      should switch to black/dark grey and black title text should also
      change to the colour white.

### Language Learners:

- As an expert language learner, I want to be able to create my own vocabulary lists
  so that I can practice specific words of my choosing.
