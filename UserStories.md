### Novice Users:
- As a novice user, I want to be able to access a help page so that I can reference it when I don't 
  remember how to use the app.

### Expert Users:
- As an expert user, I want to be able to save/load a game in progress so
  so that I can stop and resume playing at my own convenience.

  - Example:
    - Initial screen:
      
      <img src="./user-story-assets/save-menu.png" alt="save-menu" width="150px">
    
    - When 'save' button is pressed, current game state is saved and can be loaded 
     by pressing the adjacent 'load' button.


- As an expert user, I would like to be able to switch the look of the 
  application between light and dark themes so that I have a better
  time using the application in different lighting conditions.

  - Example:
    - Initial screen: 
    
      <img src="./user-story-assets/main-menu.png" alt="main menu" width="150px">
      
    - When light bulb button on top toolbar is clicked, background colour should
      should switch to black/dark grey and black title text should also
      change to the colour white.
