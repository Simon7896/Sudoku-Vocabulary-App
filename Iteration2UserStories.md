**First working version should implement functionality in accord with the user stories of iteration 1 and the TDD examples:**

**User Stories implemented from iteration 1:**

1) As a novice user, I want to be able to access a help page so that I can reference it when I don't
remember how to use the app.

- This is achieved by clicking the "?" symbol on the top right screen when clicking the button play. This button 
gives a quick overview of how the game of Soduko is played and how our version with vocabulary instead of numbers work.

2) As a novice user, I want to be able to access the word bank so that I can study and
review the words before I play the game.

- This user story has only the UI ready for it, for now only with the button labelled "animals". This button does not work but full control of the word bank will be implemented in iteration 3.

3) As a expert language learner, I want many categories of words such as foods, animals, travel, to choose from so that I can improve my vocabulary in chunks and become faster at categorizing the vocabulary.

- So far only the UI with the animal button as mentioned before, and a button called "play" to play the game are implemented, to be finished in iteration 3.

4) As a language teacher, I want to be able to choose the words that were taught this week to reinforce the learning.

- Only one category has been implemented, to be finished in iteration 3.

5) As a language teacher, I want to be able navigate back to the history of wordlists ive created so I can use them for future cohorts of students.

- The UI is finished for this, to be functioning in iteration 3.

**User Stories to be implemented from iteration 1 to iteration 3:**

1) As a novice user, I want there to be a stopwatch timer so that I can see how long it takes for me to solve the sudoku.

- This will probably be displayed on the top of the screen or within some other button at the top of the screen.

2) As an expert user, I want to be able to save/load a game in progress so
so that I can stop and resume playing at my own convenience.

- This will also have a button at the top or be joint all in one button with the timer included.

3) As an expert user, I would like to be able to switch the look of the
application between light and dark themes so that I have a better
time using the application in different lighting conditions.

- This will probably be a button with a "moon" symbol indicating light or dark mode.

4) As a beginner language learner, I want a list of vocabulary words that I keep getting wrong so that I can focus more on the mistaken words to improve my knowledge.

- This will appear in the word bank option from the home menu, probably with a button named "mistaken words".

5) As a medium language learner, I want the option of having a "favourite" option for the vocabulary words
so that I can refer back to it. For example, clicking the unfilled in bookmark beside the word will put it into the bookmarked words page.

- This will also be happening in the word bank option from the home menu, buttons will have the bookmark symbol and when clicking it, it will be saved in a favorite button.

6) As a language teacher, I want a pronunciation feature for the words so my students could learn how to say it.

- This will be a feature on the pop-up screen when pressing a cell on the Soduko board. It will probably have the speaker symbol which then produces a text to speech audio when clicking the symbol.  


**Add user stories and examples for the following additional requirements, with a plan to implement these in iteration 3:**

****Different Devices****

1) As a vocabulary learner practicing at home, I want to use my tablet for Sudoku vocabulary practice, so that the words will be conveniently displayed in larger, easier to read fonts.

- For example, when on a tablet, the boards words and cells fonts should be way bigger, when clicking on the cells of the soduko board, the popup should appear with larger words and choices.

2) As a vocabulary learner taking the bus, I want to use my phone in landscape mode for Sudoku vocabulary practice, so that longer words are displayed in a larger font than standard mode.

- when using landscape mode (turning your phone sideways), the fonts should appear bigger and the words are visible inside the cells of the sudoku board.

3) As a vocabulary learner always on the move, I want to save my progress on my phone/tablet for Sudoku vocabulary practice, so that I can resume my progress at a later time.

- Having a save/load button on the top of the sudoku board screen will make users come back where they started without losing any progess they have made playing Sudoku.

4) As a vocabulary learner practicing late at night at home, I want to use my phone/tablet in dark mode for Sudoku vocabulary practice, so that my eyes dont feel strained from the bright colours of app.

- Using a phone or tablet at night can be hard on the eyes due to the bright colours, having an option to have a dark board with light colored words can reduce eye strain.

5) As an expert vocabulary learner, I want my phone to be able to use the hard difficulty mode (12x12) Sudoku board, so that I can play anywhere and
not needing a tablet in order to play the bigger board.

- Having the hard difficulty board (12x12) implement a vertical and horizontal scroll bars to provide travsering across the board would make it easier for phone users to look around the board using the scroll bar. 


****Different Size Sudoku Grids****

1) As a teacher of elementary and junior high school children, I want scaled versions of Sudoku that use 4x4 and 6x6 grids. In the 6x6 grid version, the overall grid should be divided into rectangles of six cells each (2x3).

- This would be an easy difficulty since the board is smaller and therefore less vocabulary to to be implemented in the cells. There will be a menu after clicking play to choose difficulty and this user story will fall under the easy difficulty.

2) As a vocabulary learner who wants an extra challenging mode, I want a 12x12 version of Sudoku to play on my tablet. The overall grid should be divided into rectangles of 12 cells each (3x4).

- This will be the hard mode. It will be easier to play on a tablet since it would be a clearer board and the words would fit in the cells. However on the iphone there will be vertical and horizontal scroll bars for the user to easily traverse through the board.

3) As a vocabulary learner who learns languages for fun, I want a regular Sudoku board (9x9). The overall grid will be divided into rectangles of nine cells each (3x3).

- This will be the normal mode. This board is implemented in iteration 2 for an example.

4) As a vocabulary learner who wants a challenge but not a too easy mode, I want a regular Sudoku board (9x9) with an option for less words to be filled out in the cells. The overall grid will be divided into rectangles of nine cells each (3x3).

- Similar to the above story 3), the implementation will include an option for less words to be present in the cells so it is a bit more challenging for the user.
